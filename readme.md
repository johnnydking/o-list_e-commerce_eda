## Description

While the design of the dataset being explored would be best suited for storage in a database file and exploration via SQL, I plan to refrain from using SQL simply for the purpose of exercising skills in Pandas; namely transformation, merges, pivots and filtering.

I'll explore all aspects of the dataset but with a particular focus on marketing campaigns.
